We have to implement a lexical analyzer that lists out tokens of C# (C sharp) using lex tool.

Our zip file contains the following files-
--lexical.l
--readme
--lex.yy.c(output file)
--a.out(output file)
To run the file ,we have to type following commands in terminal:

1)flex filename.l
  Ex: flex lexical.l
  
2)gcc lex.yy.c
3)./a.out  

4)Enter strings for listing out the tokens.
